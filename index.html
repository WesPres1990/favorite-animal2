        <h2>Information</h2>
        
        <p>
            Lions are large felines that are traditionally depicted as the "king of the jungle." 
            These big cats once roamed Africa, Asia and Europe. However, now they are found in 
            only two areas of the world and are classified into two subspecies. Asiatic lions live 
            in India's Gir Forest; African lions live in central and southern Africa. Though they 
            look similar, these two subspecies are very different in size, habitat, diet and more.

            The African lion is 4.5 to 6.5 feet (1.4 to 2 meters) long from its head to its rump, 
            and its tail measures from 26.25 to 39.5 inches (67 to 100 centimeters) long. African lions 
            typically weigh 265 to 420 lbs. (120 to 191 kilograms). Asiatic lions tend to be much bigger, 
            according to the World Wildlife Federation (WWF). They weigh 300 to 500 lbs. (120 to 226 kg) 
            and are 6.56 to 9.18 feet (200 to 280 cm) long. Their tails measure 23.62 to 35.43 inches (60 to 90 cm).
